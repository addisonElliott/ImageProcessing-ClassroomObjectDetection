# ECE438 - Image Processing Final Project

This project utilizes image processing techniques to identify the number of fingers a person is holding up for a given image. The image should contain one hand with 1 to 5 fingers being held up. If the person does not hold up any fingers, this will be incorrectly identified as 1 finger being held up. In the future, this algorithm could be extended to distinguish between 0 and 1 fingers.

To run the project, run *main.py* to start the GUI. Click to run algorithm on training or testing images.
